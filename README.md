# Arduino Nano-based Designing Stick Man Animation on LCD Screen
LCD functions as a character viewer. Generally, the characters displayed are in the form of writing, but actually LCD can also display images, even LCD can also display an animation from the results of looping. The purpose of this project is to educate the public on how to make easy character customization on I2C LCD. This project has been implemented and takes approximately 1 day. The result of this project is Stick Man animation.
